# wk2-portfolio-assignment
Repository for my bomb portfolio

## Description

This project aims to create a space to show off me and the work I complete as I go through this bootcamp. I wanted to make it not only functional, but visually appealing as well. The project was intended to look somewhat like the mock-up provided, and I believe I did a good job of that. I took some creative liberties, but it is essentially the same.  This project will make it easy for future employers to come to one common place and recievev all the information they need to decide whether or not I am worth interviewing. I learned a lot about flexboxes in the creation of this project, as well as getting more familiar with the box model.

## Usage
This application is simple. A viewer can simply click this  <a href="https://stewartjoseph24.github.io/wk2-portfolio-assignment/">link</a> and see all the information they need.

## Credits

All work for this project was original. I followed the guide of a mock-up provided by KU, and did some research, but all works are original.
